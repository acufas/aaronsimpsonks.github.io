        <p>Hi! My name is Aaron Simpson. I live in Kansas City and work at <a href="https://trevipay.com">TreviPay</a>,
        where I help businesses grow.</p>
        <p><b>Email</b>: <a href="mailto:aaron@aaronsimpson.org">aaron@aaronsimpson.org</a>.</p>
        <p>I <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation/">love getting
        email</a>, so please reach out and let's talk! I'll try to respond to every (good-faith) message I receive.</p>
        <p>Areas of interest:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Computer/Information Security.</b>
                As software eats the world, vulnerabilities will eat software.
                The systems we build must be secure and resilient.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Civic Technology.</b>
                Tech can be a powerful tool for democratic systems. Modern, liberal
                governments should have the best technology we can offer. Activists should be empowered
                with digital tools for data and communication.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Mathematics/Computing Education.</b>
                Numbers are beautiful and computers are cool. Whether through established institutions or building new
                ones, how do we teach the next generation of knowledge workers?
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Business, Marketing, and Sales.</b>
                I'm not the best engineer. I'm not the best marketer. I'm certainly not a good salesperson. However,
                being decent at all of them is more valuable than being excellent at just one.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Open-Source Technology.</b>
                Open access to data. Software built in public. The best tools built by volunteers for free.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Philanthropy, Effective Altruism, and Nonprofits.</b>
                How do we do the most good? What are the most effective charities? Can we apply the principles of
                startups to nonprofits? See also: Mozilla Foundation, Linux Foundation.
            </li>
