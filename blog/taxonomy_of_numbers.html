        <h2>The Taxonomy of Numbers</h2>
        <p>There are a variety of numbers we encounter in mathematics and they can be classified into various sets. Here are a few of the
        most important ones.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The <b>Empty Set</b>: ∅ = {} = {x | x != x}
                <p>The set with no elements. The definition is a bit peculiar, but makes logical sense — the set of elements X such 
                that X is not equal to itself is empty, since there is no number that is not equal to itself.</p>
            </li>
            <li>The <b>Natural Numbers</b>: N = {1, 2, 3, ...}</li>
            <li>The <b>Whole Numbers</b>: W = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}</li>
            <li>The <b>Integers</b>: Z = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}</li>
            <li>The <b>Rational Numbers</b>: Q = {a/b | a ∈ Z and b ∈ Z}
                <p>Rational numbers are the ratios of integers, assuming the bottom integer is nonzero. Furthermore, the decimal form of
                a rational number either ends (0.25) or repeats the same sequence (0.666666666666...).</p>
            </li>
            <li>The <b>Real Numbers</b>: R = {x | x can be represented as a decimal}</li>
            <li>The <b>Irrational Numbers</b>: P = {x | x is a non-rational real number}
                <p>Defined using the above set, an irrational number is a number that is non-rational and real. They are <strong>real</strong>
                because they can be represented as a decimal, and <strong>non-rational</strong> because their decimal representation does not
                end nor repeat. Examples are pi, the constant e, the square root of 2, and more.</p>
            </li>
            <li>The <b>Complex Numbers</b>: C = {a + bi | a,b ∈ R and i = √−1}
                <p>The set of all numbers that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are <strong>real numbers</strong>
                and i is defined as the square root of -1. Useful in physics and other forms of applied mathematics.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>With some thought, this taxonomy gets a bit more interesting. You'll see that the set of Whole Numbers contains all
        the Natural Numbers. Furthermore, the Integers contain all the Whole Numbers, plus negative integers. Since every Integer can be represented
        by itself over 1, all Integers are Rational Numbers. Every Rational Number has a decimal form, so all Rational Numbers are Real Numbers.
        The Irrational Numbers are also Real Numbers, as stated in their definition. Finally, if we set b equal to 0, we can represent every one of these numbers in the form
        a + bi, so they all fall under the Complex Numbers.</p>
